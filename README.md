# Boundary_value_ex_for_ordinary_diff_eq   
   
Programmed solution of the boundary value problem for an ordinary differential equation     
with boundary conditions using the mesh method in such a way that the step h of covering a segment    
with a mesh of nodes can be condensed, and the results can be compared with each other.
